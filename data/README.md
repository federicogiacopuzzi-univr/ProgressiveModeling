# Overview
## Description
This dataset is part of the CityLearn Challenge 2023, which focuses on energy demand forecasting in smart cities. It contains historical data related to energy consumption, targeting various buildings in a simulated urban environment.
The dataset is used to train predictive models for energy demand forecasting, aiming to optimize energy usage in urban spaces. This data includes features such as building energy consumption, outdoor temperatures, and other factors that influence energy demand.
### Dataset Source
The dataset is publicly available as part of the [CityLearn Challenge 2023](https://www.citylearn.net/citylearn_challenge/2023.html). It was provided by CityLearn as part of the competition, which aims to benchmark machine learning models for smart city energy prediction.
## Data Format
The dataset is organized into a series of CSV files, each representing different aspects of the data.
### Main files in the dataset
- Building_1.csv
- Building_2.csv
- Building_3.csv
- carbon_intensity.csv
- pricing.csv
- weather.csv
The first three files represent the energy consumption for three different buildings in the dataset, while the remaining files provide additional contextual information regarding energy prices, carbon emissions, and weather conditions.
